# 100-days-coding-Challenge
100 days , 300 codes Challenge !!!!!!!!

# DAY-1
[Question 1: Install Node.js, TypeScript and VS Code on your computer/Laptop.

Explain & TIP: Simply install the following things via any browser of your choice.

Question 2: Personal Message: Store a person’s name in a variable and print a message to them, like “Hello Asharib, would you like to learn some TypeScript today?”

Explain & TIP: First, make a variable to save a name. Then, use this name to say hello. Variables keep data you can use later. 

Question 3: Name Cases: Store a person’s name in a variable, and then print that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase.

Explain & TIP: Save a name in a variable. Show it in all small letters, ALL BIG LETTERS, and First Letter Big for each word. This helps learn how to change text style.]


# DAY-2
[Question 4: Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks:
"Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”"

Explain & TIP: Simply choose a quote you like and show it with who said it. It's about combining text.

Question 5: Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 1, but this time store the famous person’s name in a variable called famous_person. Then compose your message and store it in a new variable called message. Print your message.

Explain & TIP: First, save the author's name in a variable. Next, create your quote message in another variable. Then, show it. This teaches you to organize and use your data with variables.

Question 6: Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Use "\t" (tab) and "\n" (new line) at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after stripping the white spaces.

Explain & TIP: Save a name with extra spaces or new lines around it. Show it first with the extra space, then remove the spaces and show it clean. This helps you learn how to clean up text.]

# DAY-3
[Question 7: Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Enclose your operations in print statements.

Explain & TIP: Play with numbers to get 8 using different math operations. It's a fun way to see how you can perform calculations in code.

Question 8: You should create four lines that look like this:
console.log(5 + 3)
Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.

Explain & TIP: Just like before, use basic math operations to display the number 8. This reinforces how to display outputs in coding.

Question 9: Favorite Number: Store your favorite number in a variable. Then, create a message revealing your favorite number. Print that message.

Explain & TIP: Use a variable to remember your favorite number. Then, show a message with it. This is a great way to see how variables can hold different types of data, like numbers.]


# DAY-4
[Question 10: Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If the programs are straightforward at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then, write one sentence describing what the program does.

Explain & TIP: Comments are notes in your code that the computer ignores. They help people understand what your code does. It's like leaving a note for yourself or someone else who might read your code later.

Question 11: Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in an array called names. Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

Explain & TIP: An array is like a list of items. You can store multiple items, like your friends' names, in one variable and access them one by one.

Question 12: Greetings: Use the array from Exercise 11. Instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The message should be the same for each person, but personalized with their name.

Explain & TIP: This builds on the previous exercise. Now, you’re not just listing names, you’re using them in a sentence to make a personalized message for each friend.]

# DAY-5
[Question 13: Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

Explain & TIP: Arrays help you group related items, like types of transportation. This way, you can talk about each one using a loop.


Question 14: Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

Explain & TIP: Just like with transportation, you can use an array to manage a list of guests. Loop through the list to send each one a personal invitation.


Question 15: Changing Guest List: One of your guests can't make it to the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations with a replacement guest.

Explain & TIP: Arrays are flexible. You can replace an item if someone can't make it, then loop through the list again for new invitations.]

# DAY-6
[Question 16: More Guests: You've found a bigger dinner table, so there's room for more guests.

Explain & TIP: When you have more space, you can add more guests to your list. You can add guests at the beginning, middle, and end of an array.

Question 17: Shrinking Guest List: Unfortunately, your new table won’t arrive in time, and you can only invite two guests.

Explain & TIP: Sometimes plans change, and you'll need to adjust your guest list. Removing guests from your list is straightforward but should be done thoughtfully.

Question 18: Seeing the World: Think of at least five places you’d like to visit.

Explain & TIP: Arrays can be ordered and reordered in various ways without altering the original list, useful for planning and organizing information.]

# DAY-7
[Question 19: Dinner Guests: Use one of your programs from Exercises 14 through 18 to print a message indicating the number of people you are inviting to dinner.

Explain & TIP: Arrays have a length property that tells you how many items are in the list. Use this to inform your guests how big the party will be.


Question 20: Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else you’d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

Explain & TIP: Arrays are perfect for keeping a collection of similar items. Choose a theme you like and list several examples.

Question 21: Think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object. Write a program that creates Objects containing these items.

Explain & TIP: Objects in TypeScript can store various related data about a single entity. Think of an object as a container for characteristics of something, like a book or a car.]

# DAY-8
[Question 22: Intentional Error: Try to produce an array index error in one of your programs. Correct the error before finishing.

Explain & TIP: Array index errors happen when you try to access a position in the array that doesn’t exist. Experimenting with this helps you understand array boundaries.

Question 23: Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Predict the results of each test.

Explain & TIP: Conditional tests check if something is true or false. Writing different tests helps you understand how conditions work in programming.

Question 24: More Conditional Tests: Expand your conditional tests to cover a wider range of comparisons.

Explain & TIP: Experiment with different types of conditions to see how they work. This builds a deeper understanding of logic in programming.]

# DAY-9
[Question 25: Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Assign 'green', 'yellow', or 'red' to a variable called alien_color.

Explain & TIP: Use an if statement to check the alien's color. This introduces you to simple conditionals.

Question 27: Alien Colors #3: Convert your if-else chain to handle three colors: green, yellow, red.

Explain & TIP: This exercise introduces you to handling multiple specific conditions in an if-else chain.]

# DAY-10
[Q28 - Stages of Life: Write an if-else chain that determines a person’s stage of life. Set a value for the variable age, and then:

If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is a baby.

If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that the person is a toddler.

If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 13, print a message that the person is a kid.

If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print a message that the person is a teenager.

If the person is at least 20 years old but less than 65, print a message that the person is an adult.

If the person is age 65 or older, print a message that the person is an elder.

Q29 - Favorite Fruit: Make a array of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your array.

Make a array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.

Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your array. If the fruit is in your array, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!

Q30 - Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:

If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?

Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.]

# DAY-11
[Q31 - No Users: Add an if test to Exercise 28 to make sure the list of users is not empty.

If the list is empty, print the message We need to find some users!

Remove all of the usernames from your array, and make sure the correct message is printed.

Q32 - Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.

Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.

Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.

Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.

Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted.

Q33 - Ordinal Numbers: Ordinal numbers indicate their position in a array, such as 1st or 2nd. Most ordinal numbers end in th, except 1, 2, and 3.

Store the numbers 1 through 9 in a array.

Loop through the array.

Use an if-else chain inside the loop to print the proper ordinal ending for each number. Your output should read "1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th", and each result should be on a separate line.]

# Day-12
[Question 34: Pizzas: Share your favorite pizzas and express your love for them.

Explain & TIP: Use a for loop to iterate over your pizza list, allowing you to express your preference for each type. This demonstrates looping through an array and appending custom messages to each item.


Question 35: Animals: Highlight animals with a common trait.

Explain & TIP: Looping through an array of animals allows you to comment on each one individually. This teaches you how to personalize messages within a loop based on array items.

Question 36: T-Shirt: Create a function for customizing t-shirts.

Explain & TIP: Writing a function that accepts parameters allows you to reuse code efficiently. This introduces you to function parameters and printing dynamic content based on those parameters.

Answer: Please try to do it yourself first!]
