100 days , 300 codes Challenge !!!!!!!!

# DAY-1
[Question 1: Install Node.js, TypeScript and VS Code on your computer/Laptop.

Explain & TIP: Simply install the following things via any browser of your choice.

Question 2: Personal Message: Store a person’s name in a variable and print a message to them, like “Hello Asharib, would you like to learn some TypeScript today?”

Explain & TIP: First, make a variable to save a name. Then, use this name to say hello. Variables keep data you can use later. 

Question 3: Name Cases: Store a person’s name in a variable, and then print that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase.

Explain & TIP: Save a name in a variable. Show it in all small letters, ALL BIG LETTERS, and First Letter Big for each word. This helps learn how to change text style.]


# DAY-2
[Question 4: Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks:
"Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”"

Explain & TIP: Simply choose a quote you like and show it with who said it. It's about combining text.

Question 5: Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 1, but this time store the famous person’s name in a variable called famous_person. Then compose your message and store it in a new variable called message. Print your message.

Explain & TIP: First, save the author's name in a variable. Next, create your quote message in another variable. Then, show it. This teaches you to organize and use your data with variables.

Question 6: Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Use "\t" (tab) and "\n" (new line) at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after stripping the white spaces.

Explain & TIP: Save a name with extra spaces or new lines around it. Show it first with the extra space, then remove the spaces and show it clean. This helps you learn how to clean up text.]

# DAY-3
[Question 7: Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Enclose your operations in print statements.

Explain & TIP: Play with numbers to get 8 using different math operations. It's a fun way to see how you can perform calculations in code.

Question 8: You should create four lines that look like this:
console.log(5 + 3)
Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.

Explain & TIP: Just like before, use basic math operations to display the number 8. This reinforces how to display outputs in coding.

Question 9: Favorite Number: Store your favorite number in a variable. Then, create a message revealing your favorite number. Print that message.

Explain & TIP: Use a variable to remember your favorite number. Then, show a message with it. This is a great way to see how variables can hold different types of data, like numbers.]


# DAY-4
[Question 10: Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If the programs are straightforward at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then, write one sentence describing what the program does.

Explain & TIP: Comments are notes in your code that the computer ignores. They help people understand what your code does. It's like leaving a note for yourself or someone else who might read your code later.

Question 11: Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in an array called names. Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

Explain & TIP: An array is like a list of items. You can store multiple items, like your friends' names, in one variable and access them one by one.

Question 12: Greetings: Use the array from Exercise 11. Instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The message should be the same for each person, but personalized with their name.

Explain & TIP: This builds on the previous exercise. Now, you’re not just listing names, you’re using them in a sentence to make a personalized message for each friend.]
